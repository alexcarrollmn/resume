## Me
I do not consider myself a front-end developer. I do not consider myself a back-end developer. I hate the term full-stack, but it best describes me. I live for working on the foundation of an application - large components of the front-end, API calls and responses, build scripts, deploy scripts, accessibility, routes. I try not to pigeon-hole myself into the latest and greatest frameworks; I use them when appropriate. I care more about the user than I do about the business and will be the user's champion. I suffer from imposter syndrome at times. I love taking junior developers under my wing and challenging them to grow. I am not just a developer, I am so much more. Let's chat.
