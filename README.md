> I am a seasoned front-end engineer with a passion for good design and user experience. I have experience in the latest modern frameworks, including Angular and React, and strive to write clean, tested and accessible code. I know when, and perhaps most importantly, when not to use certain technologies. For the last three years I have been successfully working remotely as an individual contibutor and am looking forward to a role where I can help a team bring ideas to reality.
