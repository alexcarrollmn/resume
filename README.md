> I am a seasoned Front-end Engineer with a passion for good design and user experience. I have experience in the latest modern frameworks, including Angular and React and strive to write clean, tested and accessible code. I have been through the trenches and know when, but most importantly, when not to use certain technologies. I have worked in many different environments: Node, PHP, and exposure to Java projects and have experience using AWS, Heroku, Rackspace, and Bluemix.
